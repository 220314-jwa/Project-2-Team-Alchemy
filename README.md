# Project 2: Group Project
This project is meant to show not only your ability to write code and tests, but also to work on a team using Agile/Scrum.

## Setup
1. Your team will spend 15-20 minutes coming up with ideas for the project. You should come up with 2-3 ideas, then write a 1-2 sentence proposal for each application and send it to me.
3. Once I have approved one of your proposals, your team will write 5-10 user stories for the project. Assign point values to each story, then add the stories to a Trello board and share it with me.
4. Your team will need to create GitHub repositories for the front end and back end, then share these with me as well (or just create them in the 220314-jwa organization).
5. Create an ERD for the application and share/discuss the draft with me so that I can make suggestions as necessary.
6. You must always write a Cucumber feature file before beginning work on a particular feature so that you can establish the expected behaviors with your team.

## Project Work
1. Daily standup every morning before 10:30, then at 10:30, we will meet in the main room and each team lead will provide me the updates for the team. Keep standup notes on GitHub as well.
2. Track the progress of user stories on Trello: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Peer Review, and Complete.
3. Manage a burndown chart based on the story points and completion dates.

## Functional Requirements
1. Data must be stored and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database (local or AWS).
2. Back end will be a Spring Boot project.
3. Data access will use Spring Data JPA, and HTTP handling will use Spring Web MVC.
4. Back end unit testing will use JUnit and Mockito, and integration testing will also Mock MVC.
5. Front end must be created using Angular.
6. Front end must be tested using Selenium with Cucumber.

## Bonus Requirements
1. Have the front end and back end fully deployed on AWS.
